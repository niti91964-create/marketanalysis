# Moving Beyond High-Level Data: How Does NMSC's 4-Level Segmentation Unlock Deeper Market Understanding?

I recently went through the [Two-Wheelers Market](https://www.nextmsc.com/report/two-wheelers-market-at3073) report from Next Move Strategy Consulting. What stood out immediately was the segmentation depth, which goes up to four levels. Most standard reports from other firms tend to stop after two or three levels, offering a broad but somewhat surface-level view.

This granularity moves the insights from theoretical to practical. It allows for pinpointing specific niche opportunities and understanding nuanced consumer trends, making it significantly more actionable for strategic decisions than the broader data found in typical reports.
